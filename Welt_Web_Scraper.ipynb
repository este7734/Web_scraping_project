              "TextBlob(\"North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet sees responsibility after the big corona outbreak at meat producer Tönnies. Now the liability of the company should be checked. Source: WELT After the big corona outbreak at meat producer Tönnies, North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has the company's liability checked. When asked whether the company should be held liable, Laschet told the editorial network Germany (Friday): \"It is currently being examined very carefully whether and which rules the company has violated and where it can be held liable.\" Laschet emphasized that he sees Tönnies as responsible. The prime minister defended his government against criticism of being late in working against the meat company. \"The working conditions in the slaughterhouses were known,\" Laschet told the RND. “Red-green has introduced the work contracts that have become a problem. Our health minister Karl-Josef Laumann was the only one who really pressed for a change. “However, there was no majority for a legal change, said Laschet. \"You have to admit it soberly.\" In a slaughterhouse of the Tönnies company in North Rhine-Westphalia, more than 1500 people have been tested positive for the virus in the past few days. In the Gütersloh district, which was badly hit by the outbreak, numerous people have already had themselves tested voluntarily. The results brought a glimmer of hope, since the tests have shown that there are only a few infected people in the population. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia has temporarily restricted everyday life for the two affected districts Gütersloh and Warendorf until June 30th. Green Party leader Anton Hofreiter asked the entrepreneur Clemens Tönnies on the news portal Watson (Friday) to pay for the cost of the Corona outbreak himself: \"If Mr. Tönnies is serious about his apology to the people in his region, I expect that he pays the costs of the Corona outbreak at Tönnies out of his huge private fortune. And it does not impose a burden on the company and thereby continue to squeeze out its employees. ”The German Patient Protection Foundation, however, accuses the Federal Government of not sufficiently taking care of the infection process in German care facilities. “After just a few days, there were figures on the corona infection process in the meat industry. But how it looks with the more than 800,000 people in need of care in the homes is still unclear, ”said Eugen Brysch, board member of the RND. In Gütersloh, people not only fight for the corona virus, but also for their vacation. If you come from a lockdown area, you need a negative corona test in many places. Source: WELT Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn (CDU) sees the \"corona crisis\" as a \"completely new feeling of community\" in Germany, as he said in a live talk for the news portals of the Funke media group. He also promoted \"that we should keep this: a kind of corona patriotism\". Spahn warned against stigmatizing people from the affected districts. \"In the end, they tend to be victims of the circumstances,\" said the minister.\")"
